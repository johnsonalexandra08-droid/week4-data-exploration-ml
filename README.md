# Week 4 - Data Exploration and Feature Engineering

**Student:** Hannah Johnson  
**Course:** Introduction to Machine Learning  
**Assignment:** Week 4 Data Exploration and Modeling  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  

## Assignment Overview

This project demonstrates data exploration, feature engineering, and basic machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to understand the dataset, prepare features, build a simple model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Breast Cancer dataset** from scikit-learn. The objective is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical features.

## Tasks Completed

- Explored dataset structure and summary statistics  
- Visualized feature distributions and relationships  
- Identified numerical features  
- Created a new engineered feature  
- Split data into training and test sets  
- Trained a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluated model accuracy  
- Reflected on feature engineering decisions
